# Birthday Wishes

Lightweight interactive birthday wishes page. Drop messages, copy a shareable link, and celebrate!

## How to use
1. Upload the project files to a GitHub repository (public).
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch (main) or use the provided GitHub Actions workflow.
3. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` to view the site.

## Notes
- Messages are stored in the browser (localStorage).
- "Save publicly" creates a short shareable link that, when opened, appends the message to the recipient's localStorage and shows confetti.
